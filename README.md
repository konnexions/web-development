In the famous words of "I don't know. Who cares":
>Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots.
>So far, the Universe is winning.


So, for backend sessions, make sure you have:
* Installed a Linux operating system. Because:
  - "Microsoft is not the answer. Microsoft is the question. NO is the answer."
* Installed git and pip
  * `sudo apt-get update`
  * `sudo apt-get install git`
  * `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`
* Installed Virtual Environment ( We are going to use pipenv )
  * `pip3 install --user pipenv`

* Make a virtual environment:
  * `pipenv --python 3.6`
* Activate the environment
  * `pipenv shell`

* Install django
  * `pip install django`

> You're ready to go now. Come. Let's make a dent in this universe together.
